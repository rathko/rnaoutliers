rnaoutliers

Roadmap:
x counting + normalization and statistics
- only takes the RNA that has at least 5 mean-occurences (mean of the occurences) across all 3 samples within a given condition
- do the t-test comparisons between
N2C vs N2A
       N2B
       N2D
       N2AN
DC vs DA
      DB
      DD
      DAD
- t-test should compare 3 sample from each condition against 3 samples from other condition
  (so essentially it will compare 3 numbers against 3 other numbers)
- show the most significant RNAs (with lowest p-values) across all conditions



- do the alignment for visualisations
- sequence logos for edited miRNA (see seqLogo from Bioconductor)


Between 2013-03-13 and 2013-04-01 - package this code, make simple documentation, help with writing a one page report

After 2013-04-01 - look into 
Look into bwa aligner (burrows-wheeler aligner)

- send number on the UCL card + expiration
